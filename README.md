# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application

The goal of my application was to create an online ordering page for a fake coffee shop called Starcents. Modeled off of Starbucks coffee and other drinks, the Starcents websites allows users to find drinks of their liking and checkout. They can filter the drinks based on hot or iced drinks and even find seasonal/holiday drinks or browse the classic menu. Since buying coffee from a coffee shop can be a bit more expensive than making it at home users can also filter the drinks by price to find the cheapest drink option!

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes
